# Overview

This repository documents my learning and experience from the Security Principles room on TryHackMe
The lab focuses on understanding and applying the fundamental principles of cybersecurity, which are the building blocks of every secure system.
It explores how security professionals use these core principles to protect systems, ensure data integrity, and maintain availability in real-world environments.

# Objectives

The goal of this lab is to gain hands-on understanding of:
The CIA Triad — Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
Authentication and Authorization mechanisms.
Accountability and Non-repudiation in secure systems.
The Principle of Least Privilege and Separation of Duties.
Applying these principles to strengthen system and network security.

# Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this lab, I learned how to:
Analyze and apply the CIA Triad to evaluate system security.
Implement access control and understand its real-world importance.
Identify and prevent breaches caused by poor privilege management.
Understand the role of auditing and logging for accountability.
Relate theoretical security principles to practical cybersecurity defense strategies.
